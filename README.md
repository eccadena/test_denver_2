# Project Title

**Description**: This project is a custom allocation optimization engine, developed using Python and PuLP. It is designed to dynamically adjust material allocations for partners in response to new orders, while balancing supply constraints and ensuring fair distribution based on demand, historical allocations, and real-time stock levels.

## Features

- **Dynamic Allocation**: Adjust allocations based on incoming orders, supply levels, and pre-defined partner quotas.
- **Equitability Focus**: Ensures fair distribution by prioritizing partners with lower historical allocations.
- **Stock and Demand Forecasting**: Incorporates real-time data to anticipate stock needs and depletion over a 7-day forecast period.
- **Batch Management**: Automatically selects batches and quantities for each clinic, avoiding expirations and minimizing waste.
- **Configurable Settings**: Allows for custom partner prioritization weights and allocation scaling adjustments based on demand patterns.
